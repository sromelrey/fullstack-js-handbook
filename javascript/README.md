## Course Philosophy

**Understanding the Foundation**: JavaScript abstracts you away from how the computer and browser work. To write deep, advanced JavaScript code, we need to understand how the tool functions at its core. The fundamental foundational knowledge covered here will provide plenty of "Aha!" moments and brighten your path forward.

**Frameworks vs. Core Knowledge**: While frameworks like NextJS and ReactJS are powerful and help us build applications quickly, many developers learn these frameworks without understanding the underlying JavaScript. This is dangerous - to build robust applications, you must understand the deeper parts of JavaScript that framework authors know. This course aims to give you the knowledge to open up NextJS source code and understand it, and even build your own mini-framework.

**The Weird Parts**: JavaScript's "weird parts" often come from expectations based on other programming languages. However, these weird parts are often JavaScript's most powerful and beautiful features. We'll understand the hows and whys, and occasionally point out hazards and downsides to avoid.

## Summary

This conceptual reference guide distills the deep, underlying mechanics of JavaScript that are crucial for senior developers and technical interviews. Focus areas include:

- **Execution Context & Lexical Environment**: The hidden machinery behind variable resolution and scope
- **Hoisting Mechanisms**: How JavaScript's compilation phase creates unexpected behaviors
- **Scope Chain & Closure Formation**: The lexical binding that enables advanced patterns
- **Prototype Chain & Inheritance**: JavaScript's delegation-based object model
- **The `this` Keyword**: Dynamic binding rules and context switching
- **Memory Management**: Reference vs value semantics and garbage collection implications
