# Scope - Conceptual Refresher

## Summary

- **Scope Definition**: Where a variable is available in your code - the accessibility and visibility of variables
- **Execution Context Foundation**: Scope is built on execution context, variable environment, and lexical environment concepts
- **Variable Availability**: Scope determines whether a variable is accessible from a particular location in code
- **Block Scoping (ES6)**: The `let` keyword introduces block scoping, where variables are only available within their block
- **Temporal Dead Zone**: Variables declared with `let` are in memory but inaccessible until their declaration line executes

## Core Concepts & Mechanics

### Scope: Variable Availability

Scope is where a variable is available in your code - it determines accessibility and visibility:

```javascript
var globalVar = "global"; // Global scope

function outerFunction() {
  var outerVar = "outer"; // Function scope

  function innerFunction() {
    var innerVar = "inner"; // Function scope
    console.log(globalVar, outerVar, innerVar); // All accessible
  }

  innerFunction();
  // console.log(innerVar);  // Error: innerVar not accessible here
}

outerFunction();
// console.log(outerVar);  // Error: outerVar not accessible here
```

**Critical Insight**: Scope determines where variables can be accessed - it's built on the execution context and variable environment concepts we've learned.

### Function Scope vs Block Scope

Traditional JavaScript uses function scope, while ES6 introduces block scope:

```javascript
// Function scope (traditional JavaScript)
function myFunction() {
  if (true) {
    var functionScoped = "I'm function scoped";
  }
  console.log(functionScoped); // Accessible - function scoped
}

// Block scope (ES6)
function myFunction() {
  if (true) {
    let blockScoped = "I'm block scoped";
  }
  // console.log(blockScoped);  // Error: not accessible - block scoped
}
```

**Key Understanding**: Function scope means variables are accessible throughout the entire function, while block scope means variables are only accessible within their block.

### The `let` Keyword and Block Scoping

ES6's `let` keyword introduces block scoping with important differences from `var`:

```javascript
// var behavior (function scoped)
function varExample() {
  console.log(x); // undefined (hoisted)
  var x = 10;
  console.log(x); // 10
}

// let behavior (block scoped)
function letExample() {
  // console.log(y);  // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
  let y = 20;
  console.log(y); // 20
}

// Block scoping with let
function blockScopeExample() {
  if (true) {
    let blockVar = "I'm block scoped";
    var functionVar = "I'm function scoped";
  }
  // console.log(blockVar);    // Error: not accessible
  console.log(functionVar); // Accessible
}
```

**Important Pattern**: `let` variables are block-scoped and have a temporal dead zone - they exist in memory but can't be accessed until their declaration line.

### Temporal Dead Zone

Variables declared with `let` are in memory but inaccessible until their declaration line executes:

```javascript
// Temporal Dead Zone example
function temporalDeadZone() {
  // console.log(tdzVar);  // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'tdzVar' before initialization

  let tdzVar = "I'm in the temporal dead zone until this line";
  console.log(tdzVar); // Now accessible
}

// The variable exists in memory but the engine prevents access
```

**Critical Pattern**: The temporal dead zone prevents access to `let` variables before their declaration, even though they exist in memory.

### Loop Block Scoping

Block scoping creates new variables for each iteration in loops:

```javascript
// var in loop (function scoped)
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100); // Outputs: 3, 3, 3
}

// let in loop (block scoped)
for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(j), 100); // Outputs: 0, 1, 2
}

// Each iteration gets its own 'j' variable
```

**Key Insight**: Block scoping in loops creates new variables for each iteration, solving common closure problems.

## Key Insights & Gotchas

‚Ä¢ **Scope Foundation**: Scope is built on execution context, variable environment, and lexical environment concepts

‚Ä¢ **Variable Availability**: Scope determines where variables can be accessed in your code

‚Ä¢ **Function vs Block Scope**: Traditional JavaScript uses function scope, ES6 introduces block scope with `let`

‚Ä¢ **Temporal Dead Zone**: `let` variables exist in memory but can't be accessed until their declaration line

‚Ä¢ **Block Scoping**: Variables declared with `let` are only accessible within their block (curly braces)

‚Ä¢ **Loop Block Scoping**: Each loop iteration with `let` creates a new variable, solving closure issues

‚Ä¢ **Hoisting Differences**: `var` is hoisted and accessible (with `undefined`), `let` is hoisted but inaccessible

‚Ä¢ **Scope Chain**: Scope is determined by the scope chain we learned about earlier

‚Ä¢ **Execution Context**: Each execution context has its own scope for variables

‚Ä¢ **Lexical Scoping**: Scope is determined by where code is written (lexical environment)

‚Ä¢ **Variable Shadowing**: Inner scopes can have variables with the same name as outer scopes

‚Ä¢ **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside functions are in global scope

‚Ä¢ **Function Scope**: Variables declared with `var` are accessible throughout the entire function

‚Ä¢ **Block Scope**: Variables declared with `let` are only accessible within their block

‚Ä¢ **Scope Resolution**: JavaScript resolves variables by searching through the scope chain

‚Ä¢ **Debugging Tool**: Understanding scope helps debug variable access issues and unexpected behavior

‚Ä¢ **ES6 Compatibility**: Both `var` and `let` can be used in ES6, but they behave differently

‚Ä¢ **Best Practice**: Use `let` for block scoping when you need variables to be limited to a specific block
