# Functions, Context, and Variable Environments - Conceptual Refresher

## Summary

- **Variable Environment**: Where variables live in memory and how they relate to each other within an execution context
- **Execution Context Isolation**: Each function invocation creates its own execution context with its own variable environment
- **Variable Scope**: Variables are only accessible within their own execution context, not across different contexts
- **Memory Space Separation**: Even variables with the same name exist in separate memory spaces when in different execution contexts
- **Context Stack Management**: When functions complete, their execution contexts are popped off the stack, returning to the previous context

## Core Concepts & Mechanics

### Variable Environment: Memory Space for Variables

Variable environment is simply where variables live in memory within an execution context:

```javascript
// Each execution context has its own variable environment
var myVar = 1; // Global variable environment

function a() {
  var myVar = 2; // Function a's variable environment
  console.log(myVar); // 2 (from a's environment)
}

function b() {
  var myVar; // Function b's variable environment (undefined)
  console.log(myVar); // undefined (from b's environment)
}

console.log(myVar); // 1 (from global environment)
a(); // 2 (from a's environment)
b(); // undefined (from b's environment)
console.log(myVar); // 1 (back to global environment)
```

**Critical Insight**: Variable environment is just the memory space where variables are stored within each execution context.

### Execution Context Isolation

Each function invocation creates its own execution context with isolated variable environments:

```javascript
var globalVar = "global";

function outerFunction() {
  var outerVar = "outer";

  function innerFunction() {
    var innerVar = "inner";
    console.log(globalVar, outerVar, innerVar);
  }

  innerFunction(); // Creates new execution context
}

outerFunction(); // Creates new execution context

// Each function has its own variable environment:
// Global: globalVar = "global"
// Outer:  outerVar = "outer"
// Inner:  innerVar = "inner"
```

**Key Understanding**: Variables in different execution contexts are completely isolated from each other, even if they have the same name.

### Variable Scope and Context

Variables are only accessible within their own execution context:

```javascript
var myVar = 1; // Global scope

function a() {
  var myVar = 2; // Function a's scope
  console.log(myVar); // 2 (accesses a's myVar)

  function b() {
    var myVar; // Function b's scope (undefined)
    console.log(myVar); // undefined (accesses b's myVar)
  }

  b();
}

a();
console.log(myVar); // 1 (accesses global myVar)

// Output: 2, undefined, 1
// Each myVar is in its own execution context
```

**Important Pattern**: Variables are scoped to their execution context - they can't access variables from other contexts directly.

### Memory Space Separation

Variables with the same name exist in separate memory spaces when in different execution contexts:

```javascript
var name = "Global";

function firstFunction() {
  var name = "First";
  console.log(name); // "First"

  function secondFunction() {
    var name = "Second";
    console.log(name); // "Second"
  }

  secondFunction();
  console.log(name); // "First" (back to firstFunction's context)
}

firstFunction();
console.log(name); // "Global" (back to global context)

// Each 'name' variable exists in its own memory space
// They don't interfere with each other
```

**Critical Pattern**: Same-named variables in different execution contexts are completely separate - they don't affect each other.

### Context Stack and Variable Access

When functions complete, their execution contexts are popped off the stack:

```javascript
var myVar = 1;

function a() {
  var myVar = 2;
  console.log("In a:", myVar); // 2

  function b() {
    var myVar;
    console.log("In b:", myVar); // undefined
  }

  b();
  console.log("Back in a:", myVar); // 2
}

console.log("Global before:", myVar); // 1
a();
console.log("Global after:", myVar); // 1

// Execution flow:
// 1. Global context: myVar = 1
// 2. Push a context: myVar = 2
// 3. Push b context: myVar = undefined
// 4. Pop b context: back to a context
// 5. Pop a context: back to global context
```

**Key Insight**: Variable access depends on which execution context is currently active on the stack.

## Key Insights & Gotchas

‚Ä¢ **Variable Environment Simplicity**: Variable environment is just where variables live in memory within an execution context

‚Ä¢ **Context Isolation**: Each function invocation creates its own execution context with isolated variable environments

‚Ä¢ **Same Name, Different Memory**: Variables with the same name in different contexts exist in separate memory spaces

‚Ä¢ **Scope Boundaries**: Variables are only accessible within their own execution context

‚Ä¢ **Stack Management**: When functions complete, their execution contexts are popped off the stack

‚Ä¢ **Memory Space Separation**: Variables in different execution contexts don't interfere with each other

‚Ä¢ **Context Switching**: Variable access depends on which execution context is currently active

‚Ä¢ **Function Invocation**: Each function call creates a new execution context with its own variable environment

‚Ä¢ **Global Context**: The global execution context is always at the bottom of the stack

‚Ä¢ **Variable Shadowing**: Inner contexts can have variables with the same name as outer contexts

‚Ä¢ **Memory Efficiency**: Each execution context only stores variables that belong to it

‚Ä¢ **Context Lifecycle**: Execution contexts are created when functions are invoked and destroyed when they complete

‚Ä¢ **Variable Access Rules**: Variables can only access their own execution context's variable environment

‚Ä¢ **Stack Depth**: Deep function calls create deep stacks with multiple variable environments

‚Ä¢ **Debugging Tool**: Understanding variable environments helps debug scope-related issues

‚Ä¢ **Closure Foundation**: Variable environments are the foundation for understanding closures and lexical scoping
